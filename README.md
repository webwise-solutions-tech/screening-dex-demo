# 🚀 DeFi MVP - A Minimal Decentralized Finance Platform

## 🌟 Overview
We are building an innovative DeFi platform similar to [Yam on RealT](https://staging-yam.realtoken.network), aiming to make decentralized finance accessible and efficient.
DeFi MVP is a decentralized finance platform that enables users to **stake, swap, and earn rewards** using blockchain technology. This project is built as an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** to validate core DeFi functionalities.

## 🔥 Features
- 🔗 **Token Swapping** – Trade crypto assets using a decentralized exchange (DEX).
- 💰 **Staking & Rewards** – Users can stake tokens and earn yield.
- 🛡️ **Secure Wallet Integration** – Connect using MetaMask or WalletConnect.
- 📊 **Transparent Smart Contracts** – All transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
- ⚡ **Low Gas Fees** – Optimized for efficient transactions.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js
- **Database**: IPFS (for decentralized storage)
- **Smart Contracts**: ERC-20, ERC-721 (for NFTs)
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnect

## 🚀 Getting Started
